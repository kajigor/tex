One of the most attractive applications of relational programming is program inversion. 
It offers an approach to solving complex problems by transforming verifiers into solvers with relatively low effort. 
Unfortunately, program inverters often suffer form interpretation overhead, leading to suboptimal performance compared to direct program inversions. 
A prior study introduced a functional conversion scheme capable of creating inversions of \mk specifications with respect to a known fixed direction. 
This paper expands upon it by providing a semi-automated functional conversion algorithm. 
Our evaluation demonstrates significant performance improvements achieved through functional conversion.
