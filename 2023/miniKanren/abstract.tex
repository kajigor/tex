One of the most attractive applications of relational programming is inverse computation. 
It offers an approach to solving complex problems by transforming verifiers into solvers with relatively low effort. 
Unfortunately, inverse computation often suffers from interpretation overhead, leading to subpar performance compared to direct program inversion. 
A prior study introduced a functional conversion scheme capable of creating inversions of \mk specifications with respect to a known fixed direction. 
This paper expands upon it by providing a semi-automated functional conversion algorithm. 
Our evaluation demonstrates a significant performance improvement achieved through functional conversion.
