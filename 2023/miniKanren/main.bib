abstract="This paper reports on results concerning the combination of non-standard semantics via interpreters. We define what a semantics combination means and identify under which conditions a combination can be realized by computer programs (robustness, safely combinable). We develop the underlying mathematical theory and examine the meaning of several non-standard interpreter towers. Our results suggest a technique for the implementation of a certain class of programming language dialects by composing a hierarchy of non-standard interpreters.",

abstract="We survey fundamental concepts in inverse programming and present the Universal Resolving Algorithm (URA), an algorithm for inverse computation in a first-order, functional programming language. We discuss the principles behind the algorithm, including a three-step approach based on the notion of a perfect process tree, and demonstrate our implementation with several examples. We explain the idea of a semantics modifier for inverse computation which allows us to perform inverse computation in other programming languages via interpreters.",
