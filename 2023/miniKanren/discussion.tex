\section{Discussion}

Our experiments showed that the functional conversion is capable to significantly improve performance of relational computations in the known directions.
The improvement stems from eliminating costly unifications in favor of the cheaper equality checks and pattern matches.
Beside this, we employed some heuristics which push lower-cost computations to happen sooner while delaying higher-cost ones.
It is also possible to take into account determinism of some directions and improve performance of them even more by picking an appropriate monad.

It is currently not unclear if the heuristics we used are universal enough.
However, it is always safe to run any deterministic computations because they never increase the search space.
We believe that it is necessary to integrate determinism check in the mode analysis so that the more efficient modes such as the one presented in figure~\ref{fig:mult_modded_good} could be achieved more justifiably.

We also think that further integration with specialization techniques such as partial deduction may benefit the conversion even more.
For example, the third argument of the propositional evaluator can be either \lstinline{true} or \lstinline{false}.
Specializing the evaluator for these to values may help to shave off even more time.
