\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

In this paper we described a semi-automatic functional conversion from a \mk relation with a fixed direction into a functional language.

As part of the future work, we plan to employ a determinism check in the mode analysis.
We also plan to integrate the functional conversion with specialization techniques such as partial deduction.
