\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

In this paper, we described a semi-automatic functional conversion from a \mk relation with a fixed direction into a functional language.
We implemented the proposed conversion and applied it to a set of relations, resulting in significant performance enhancement, as demonstrated in our evaluation.  
As part of the future work, we plan to augment mode analysis with determinism check.
We also plan to integrate the functional conversion with specialization techniques such as partial deduction.
