\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

In this paper, we described a semi-automatic functional conversion of a \micro relation with a fixed direction into a functional language.
We implemented the proposed conversion and applied it to a set of relations, resulting in significant performance enhancement, as demonstrated in our evaluation.  
As part of the future work, we plan to augment the mode analysis with a determinism check.
We also plan to integrate the functional conversion with specialization techniques such as partial deduction.
