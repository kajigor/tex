Functional logic programming languages such as \merc translate the logic subset of the language into a functional programming language much like we do.
\merc utilizes a strong system of modes and types to guide the compilation\todo{cite mode system paper}.
Many \mk languages are embedded into host languages which are not typed and thus we cannot rely on type information in our conversion.

It is hard to compare our implementation with \merc because of the difference in semantics.
\merc uses a system of prescriptive modes which means that the semantics is defined by the mode assigned to a program.
We use modes in a descriptive fashion, and the semantics of a \mk program is the same set of answers regardless of the order of subgoals.
This allows us to compare runtime of differently modded relational programs.

There are two papers which mention doing mode analysis in the same fashion we do.
