\section{Normal Form Abstract Syntax of \mk}

In this paper we use core \mk usually referred to as \micro.
In its syntax, a relation is a goal comprised of disjunctions or conjunctions of other goals.
A base goal can be either an explicit unification of two terms or a call to a relation.
An example program in \mk is shown in figure~\ref{fig:addo_mk}.
It relates triples of Peano natural numbers \lstinline{x}, \lstinline{y}, \lstinline{z} such that \lstinline{x + y = z}.
We use identifiers which start with the upper-case letters as constructors, and identifiers which start with the lower-case letters as variable names.
A superscript \lstinline{$^o$} denotes a relation name while the keyword \lstinline{fresh} introduces fresh variables into the scope.
To execute a relation, one should provide a query to run, for example the query \lstinline{run q (add$^o$ q q (S (S O)))} finds a number which, doubled, is 2 in Peano representation.

To simplify the functional conversion scheme, we consider \mk relations to be in the superhomogeneous normal form used in the \merc programming language~\cite{somogyi1996execution}.
Converting an arbitrary \mk relation into the normal form is a simple syntactic transformation, which we omit.

In the normal form, a term is either a variable or a constructor application which is flat and linear.
Linearity means that arguments of a constructor are distinct variables.
To be flat, a term should not contain any nested constructors.
Each constructor has a fixed arity $n$.
Below is the abstract syntax of the term language over the set of variables $V$.
\[  \FlatTerm_{V} = V \cup \{\Cons_{n}\left( x_1, \ldots, x_{n} \right) \mid x_{i}\in V; i \neq j \Rightarrow x_i \neq x_j\} \]


Whenever a term which does not adhere to this form is encountered in a unification or as an argument of a call, it is transformed into a conjunction of several unifications, as illustrated by the following examples:
\[
    \begin{array}{rll}
        C\left( x_1, x_2 \right)                      & \equiv C\left( C\left( y_1, y_2 \right), y_3 \right)                                          & \Rightarrow \\
                                                      & \multicolumn{2}{l}{\quad\Rightarrow x_1 \equiv C\left( y_1, y_2 \right) \land x_2 \equiv y_3}               \\
        C\left( C\left( x_1, x_2 \right), x_3 \right) & \equiv C\left( C\left( y_1, y_2 \right), y_3 \right)                                          & \Rightarrow \\
                                                      & \multicolumn{2}{l}{\quad\Rightarrow x_1 \equiv y_1 \land x_2 \equiv y_2 \land x_3 \equiv y_3}               \\
        x \equiv C \left(y, y \right)                 & \multicolumn{2}{l}{\quad\Rightarrow x \equiv C \left(y_1, y_2\right) \land y_1 \equiv y_2}                  \\
        add^o\left( x, x, z \right)                   & \multicolumn{2}{l}{\quad\Rightarrow add^o\left( x_1, x_2, z \right) \land x_1 \equiv x_2}
    \end{array}
\]

Unification in the normal form is restricted to always unify a variable with a term.
We also prohibit using disjunctions inside conjunctions.
The normalization procedure declares a new relation whenever this is encountered.
This is done to limit the number of possible permutations one has to consider when doing the mode inference.
