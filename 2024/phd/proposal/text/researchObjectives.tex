\section{Research Objectives}

The goal of the research is to figure out what combination of partial evaluation techniques is
capable of making the verifier-to-solver approach a reality.
This involves the following tasks: 

\begin{itemize}
  \item Explore partial deduction techniques specifically developed for logic programming, focusing on their application to relational interpreters. 
  \item Implement functional conversion to generate a function that retains the semantics of the original relational interpreter. 
  \item Integrate the specialization methods with the conversion for further speed up. 
  \item Collect a benchmark suite to evaluate the performance impact of these transformations. 
\end{itemize}
