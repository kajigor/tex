\section{Conclusion}

In conclusion, this research proposal aims to study the application of partial deduction and functional conversion within relational interpreters, focusing on converting verifiers to solvers. 
The introduction of Conservative Partial Deduction and functional conversion has shown its potential by increasing the efficiency of relational interpreters. 
The next steps involve refining these techniques and integrating them into a comprehensive system that could transform the functionality of relational interpreters. 
By conducting thorough benchmarking, this work plans to further validate the effectiveness of these methods and push the boundaries of what relational logic programming can achieve.
