There is a duality between the problems of verification and search. 
It becomes evident in the context of relational, or pure logic, programming. 
Since any program in this paradigm can be executed in different modes, one interpreter can serve as both a verifier and a solver. 
One disadvantage of this method is its often poor performance. 
Several specialization techniques can be employed to mitigate the issue based on a mode and partially known arguments, i.e. the information known prior to execution. 
The goal of this work is to leverage partial deduction techniques to improve the performance of relational interpreters within the verifier-to-solver approach.
