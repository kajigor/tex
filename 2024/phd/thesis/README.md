This is a template for writing a PhD theis. The frontmatter is adapted to thesis submission to the Saarland University, Saarbruecken in Germany. The `main.tex` holds the top-level structure of the thesis. Each chapter has its own folder which could be individual papers. The `main.bib` is created by adding references from all chapter-specific bib files. This is then sorted and any duplicates are removed.
