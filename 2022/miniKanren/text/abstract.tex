  Languages in the Kanren family strive to bridge the gap between logic and general-purpose mainstream programming.
  Logic programming comes with an overhead such as keeping track of substitutions of logic variables and unifying terms.
  However, in many practical applications there is no need to bear all that overhead, and thus we should not.
  Ideally, we should be able to automatically rewrite a relation into a function which computes the outputs but omits most unnecessary overhead.
  In this paper we present a method to translate miniKanren relations into pure functions in continuation passing stule.
  The project is at an early stage, but it is promising: the functions run much faster than the original miniKanren code.
