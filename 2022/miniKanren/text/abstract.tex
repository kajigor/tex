  In many computer science problems, verifying that a candidate is indeed a solution for a problem is easier than implementing a solver.
  At the same time, solvers can be obtained as an inversion of a verifier.
  Relational programming is specifically created to make inversion of programs easy.
  Unfortunately, relational programming comes with an overhead such as keeping track of substitutions of logic variables and unifying terms.
  However, in many practical applications there is no need to bear all that overhead, and thus it may be eliminated.
  Ideally, we should be able to automatically rewrite a relation into a function which computes the outputs but omits unnecessary overhead.
  In this paper we present a method to convert \mk relations into pure functions.
  The project is at an early stage, but it is promising: the converted functions run much faster than the original \mk code.
