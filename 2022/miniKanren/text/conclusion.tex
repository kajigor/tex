\section{Conclusion}

In this paper we described a new conversion from a \mk relation with a fixed execution direction into a functional programming language.
We manually converted several \mk relations and compared execution time of functions with their relational sources.
The evaluation showed that the conversion is able to speed up computations significantly.
We also mentioned some complicated steps within conversion and outlined directions for future research.
