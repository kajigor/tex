\begin{itemize}
  \item Relational interpeters for context (\cite{lozov2019relational})
  \item Mercury for mode analysis
  \item Curry as translation to Haskell
\end{itemize}

Automatic translation from a general purpose programming \todo{cite Lozov, unnesting} makes it possible to create relational specifications which then may be run in a direction of choice and thus do more than original program.
As an example, one may implement a simple functional verifier which checks that some candidate is indeed a solution for a search problem.
When translated into \mk, this verifier may be used to actually solve search problems with no deep knowledge required from a programmer. \todo{cite rel.interpreters}.
