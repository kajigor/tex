\section{Preliminaries}

Consider an addition relation \lstinline{add$^o$ x y z} which specifies that \z equals to \lstinline{x + y} (Listing~\ref{add}).
Having this relation, one can \emph{run} it in some \emph{direction} to compute useful data.
Running \lstinline{add$^o$} with the specific known \x and \y produces their sum as a result, implementing addition.
It is also possible to run the same relation \lstinline{add$^o$} and pass only \z and this produces all pairs of numbers which sum up to the given \z.
