\section{Future Work}

Since this project is in active phase of development, there are many directions for future work.

First of all, we need to research how to best order calls within a conjunction.
Since the order of calls greatly influences the efficiency of the converted function, this research direction is of upmost importance.
Annotations of variables with \lstinline{in} and \lstinline{out} are also affected by the order of calls and thus we need to adapt the mode analysis to take it into account.

Second of all, we plan to formalize the conversion and prove its correction.

Third of all, the conversion should be implemented either as a standalone tool or  integrated into some of the major \mk implementations.

Finally, after all these building blocks are done, we would like to integrate the conversion into a relational interpreters framework.
This would made a fullstack solution for the program inversion problem.
